Scripts to backup weewx database(s) and a v5 pip installation completely

* weewx-backup-copy.sh - run on your weewx system to stash the data reliably

* get-today.sh - quick script to pull today's stashed database(s) from the weewx system

* backup-weewx-software.sh - back up a v5 pip-installed weewx for safekeeping

(scripts are pretty obvious, see the comments therein)
